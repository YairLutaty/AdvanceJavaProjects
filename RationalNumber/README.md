# Rational Number Project

This Java program implements a rational number calculator, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on fractions (rational numbers). It ensures that numbers remain in simplified form and provides comparison functionalities.

How It Works

* Rational.java â†’ Defines the Rational class, which represents a fraction with a numerator and denominator.
  * Supports arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
  * Includes comparison methods (greaterThan, equals).
  * Reduces fractions to their simplest form.

* Main.java â†’ Handles user input, prompting the user to enter two rational numbers and displaying the results of:
  * Comparison (greaterThan, equals).
  * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
  * Automatic fraction reduction.

Features
- Validates input to prevent division by zero
- Supports arithmetic operations on rational numbers
- Automatically reduces fractions to their simplest form
- Implements comparison operations (> and ==)
