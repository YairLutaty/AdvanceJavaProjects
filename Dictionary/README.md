# Dictionary Project

This JavaFX application provides a simple dictionary where users can add, search, update, and delete words with their meanings. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and a TreeMap for efficient word management.

How It Works

* Dictionary.java → Manages word storage using a TreeMap, allowing quick lookup, insertion, and deletion.

* DictionaryController.java → Handles user interactions via buttons (add, search, delete, update, navigate words).

* DictionaryController.fxml → Defines the GUI layout (text fields, buttons, labels).

* Main.java → Loads the JavaFX UI and starts the application.

Features

- Add words and their meanings to the dictionary
- Search for words and retrieve their meanings
- Update meanings of existing words
- Delete words from the dictionary
- Navigate to the previous and next words in alphabetical order
